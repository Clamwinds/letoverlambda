The mechanism is driven by a form of selection bias, which leads to an underestimate of the true conditional probability of a given outcome when conditioning on prior outcomes of the same kind. The biased measure has been used prominently in the literature that investigates incorrect beliefs in sequential decision making -- most notably the Gambler's Fallacy and the Hot Hand Fallacy. Upon correcting for the bias, the conclusions of some prominent studies in the literature are reversed. The bias also provides a structural explanation of why the belief in the law of small numbers persists, as repeated experience with finite sequences can only reinforce these beliefs, on average.\"\n\nDefinitions\n----\nWhat is this selection bias?\nConditional Relative Frequency\nConditional probability: \"The probability of <event> given <event> has occured\"\n\n\"We demonstrate that in a finite sequence generated by i.i.d. Bernoulli trials with probability\nof success p, the relative frequency of success on those trials that immediately follow a streak\nof one, or more, consecutive successes is expected to be strictly less than p, i.e. the conditional\nrelative frequency of success is a biased estimator of the conditional probability of success. While,\nin general, the bias does decrease as the sequence gets longer, it remains substantial for a range of\nsequence lengths often used in empirical work.\"\n\nAt a first run through of this paper, I am confused to how this is different from the examples provided in Feller?\n\n\"We demonstrate that in a finite sequence generated by i.i.d. Bernoulli trials with probability\nof success p, the relative frequency of success on those trials that immediately follow a streak\nof one, or more, consecutive successes is expected to be strictly less than p, i.e. the conditional\nrelative frequency of success is a biased estimator of the conditional probability of success. While,\nin general, the bias does decrease as the sequence gets longer, it remains substantial for a range of\nsequence lengths often used in empirical work.\"\n\n\"Further, the result shows that\ndata in the hot hand fallacy literature (see Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky [1985] and Miller and\nSanjurjo [2014, 2015a,b]) has been systematically misinterpreted by researchers; for those trials\nthat immediately follow a streak of successes, observing that the relative frequency of successes is\nequal to the base rate of success, is in fact evidence in favor of the hot hand, rather than evidence\nagainst it. Tying these two implications together, it becomes clear why the inability of the gambler\nto detect the fallacy of his belief in alternation has an exact parallel with the researcher’s inability\nto detect his mistake when concluding that experts’ belief in the hot hand is a fallacy.\"\n\n\"In addition, the result has implications for evaluation and compensation systems, and suggests\nsuccessful gambling systems for (particular) games of finite length. 1\"\n\n\"On the surface, it appears impossible that the relative frequency of heads, on those flips of a\nfair coin that immediately follow a heads, is expected to be less than 1/2, and thus, by implication,\nthat the relative frequency of heads on those flips that immediately follow a tails is expected to\nbe greater than 1/2. After all, each coin flip is assigned at random either to the group of flips\nthat immediately follow a heads, or to the group of flips that immediately follow a tails. However,\nwhat this simple argument overlooks is that, for any given sequence, when calculating the relative\"\n\n\n",
