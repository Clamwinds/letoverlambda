Trying to figure out how to get my
head around rails and how to develop a
used library and make a few that would
help with rails deployments, and what
on earth react is supposed to be important
for.

I should just create an app that has
common data inside of it and can display
important data, data I think that is
important and just provide some sane
analysis. I think i just nneed to
apply some sane statistical
methodology.

What the hell is Bayes used for anyways
maybe I do need to write all my own
statistical or mathematical functions
so I can home-roll my own data analysis
or data science start up and provide
admissable conclusions
