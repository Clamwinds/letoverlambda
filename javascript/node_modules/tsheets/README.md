# Getting Started

## Initializing TimeSheet

You've to create a new object from the exported object to invoke the endpoints:

```javascript
var TimeSheet = require('tsheets'),
    timesheet = new TimeSheet('appId', 'appSecret');

// `timesheet` object is now ready i.e .auth, .jobcodes etc
```
The supplied `appId` and `appSecret` would be used in every endpoint to make the calls for data interchange.
