Static websites
--

is just a folder w/ web page files, each page of the site is a
different page of the file, web pages are written in html

html tag wrapped around each of these 'discrete' elements

headers
subheaders
images
paragraphs
lists
addresses

Internet = connected computers & servers, every one can view website files, but servers
require passwords to be able to edit those websites
Html is used to identify content not style it, CSS is used for that.


How does the Internet work?
--
An interconnected network is a minitaure version of how the internet works, we need
three key things

1) set of rules for packaging data

2)interconnected networks

3)Route the data across the internet


Post offices = Pops = Local
Sorting offices = Naps = National

Data is sent in packets with instructions on how to recreate the original file, like sending
instructions on how to build a diy


routers are equivilent to staff in the post office
