This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Code that gelman supplies, evaluate with print(mean(prob, na.rm=TRUE))
```{r}
rep <- 1e6
n <- 10
data <- array(sample(c(0,1), rep*n, replace=TRUE), c(rep,n))
prob <- rep(NA, rep)
for (i in 1:rep){
  heads1 <- data[i,1:(n-1)]==1
  heads2 <- data[i,2:n]==1
  prob[i] <- sum(heads1 & heads2)/sum(heads1)
}

```


Abstract of paper

"We find a subtle but substantial bias in a standard measure of the conditional dependence of present outcomes on streaks of past outcomes in sequential data. The mechanism is driven by a form of selection bias, which leads to an underestimate of the true conditional probability of a given outcome when conditioning on prior outcomes of the same kind. The biased measure has been used prominently in the literature that investigates incorrect beliefs in sequential decision making -- most notably the Gambler's Fallacy and the Hot Hand Fallacy. Upon correcting for the bias, the conclusions of some prominent studies in the literature are reversed. The bias also provides a structural explanation of why the belief in the law of small numbers persists, as repeated experience with finite sequences can only reinforce these beliefs, on average."

What is this selection bias?
Conditional Relative Frequency
Conditional probability: "The probability of <event> given <event> has occured"

"We demonstrate that in a finite sequence generated by i.i.d. Bernoulli trials with probability
of success p, the relative frequency of success on those trials that immediately follow a streak
of one, or more, consecutive successes is expected to be strictly less than p, i.e. the conditional
relative frequency of success is a biased estimator of the conditional probability of success. While,
in general, the bias does decrease as the sequence gets longer, it remains substantial for a range of
sequence lengths often used in empirical work."

At a first run through of this paper, I am confused to how this is different from the examples provided in Feller?

"We demonstrate that in a finite sequence generated by i.i.d. Bernoulli trials with probability
of success p, the relative frequency of success on those trials that immediately follow a streak
of one, or more, consecutive successes is expected to be strictly less than p, i.e. the conditional
relative frequency of success is a biased estimator of the conditional probability of success. While,
in general, the bias does decrease as the sequence gets longer, it remains substantial for a range of
sequence lengths often used in empirical work."

"Further, the result shows that
data in the hot hand fallacy literature (see Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky [1985] and Miller and
Sanjurjo [2014, 2015a,b]) has been systematically misinterpreted by researchers; for those trials
that immediately follow a streak of successes, observing that the relative frequency of successes is
equal to the base rate of success, is in fact evidence in favor of the hot hand, rather than evidence
against it. Tying these two implications together, it becomes clear why the inability of the gambler
to detect the fallacy of his belief in alternation has an exact parallel with the researcher’s inability
to detect his mistake when concluding that experts’ belief in the hot hand is a fallacy."

"In addition, the result has implications for evaluation and compensation systems, and suggests
successful gambling systems for (particular) games of finite length. 1"

"On the surface, it appears impossible that the relative frequency of heads, on those flips of a
fair coin that immediately follow a heads, is expected to be less than 1/2, and thus, by implication,
that the relative frequency of heads on those flips that immediately follow a tails is expected to
be greater than 1/2. After all, each coin flip is assigned at random either to the group of flips
that immediately follow a heads, or to the group of flips that immediately follow a tails. However,
what this simple argument overlooks is that, for any given sequence, when calculating the relative"
